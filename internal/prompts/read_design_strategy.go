1. Start with get_metadata — understand file name, pages, and current page
2. Use get_pages to list all pages without loading their full trees
3. Use get_design_context (depth=2, detail=compact) for a token-efficient summary of the current selection or page
   - detail=minimal: id/name/type/bounds only (~5% tokens)
   - detail=compact: + fills/strokes/effects/opacity (~30% tokens)
   - detail=full: everything, default (100% tokens)
   - dedupe_components=true: INSTANCE nodes are collapsed to compact stubs (mainComponentId + componentProperties overrides);
     unique component structures are collected once in a top-level componentDefs map.
     Use this whenever the screen contains repeated component instances (e.g. card lists, table rows, nav items).
     Typical savings: 5–10× fewer tokens vs full serialization of repeated instances.
4. For screens with many repeated components, the recommended reading flow is:
   a. get_design_context(depth=2, detail=minimal, dedupe_components=true) — see the instance layout + component IDs
   b. Inspect componentDefs in the response — one definition per unique component, not one per instance
   c. Read componentProperties on each instance stub — variant selections, text overrides, boolean toggles
   d. Drill into specific instances with get_node only when an instance has unique overrides you need to inspect
5. Use search_nodes to find nodes by name or type without dumping the entire tree
6. Drill into specific nodes with get_node or get_nodes_info (prefer batch over single calls)
7. For text-heavy components, use scan_text_nodes to collect all copy at once
8. Use scan_nodes_by_types to find all FRAME/COMPONENT/INSTANCE nodes in a subtree
9. Call get_styles and get_variable_defs once per session to understand the design system
10. Call get_fonts to understand typography usage across the page at a glance
11. Use get_viewport to see what the user is currently looking at in the canvas
12. Use get_reactions to inspect prototype interactions on a node
13. Call get_screenshot last and only when visual confirmation is needed — it is expensive
14. Node IDs use colon format: 4029:12345 — never use hyphens
15. get_local_components returns componentSets and variantProperties for variant-aware inspection`),
